Create a file and get it's **absolute** file path and pass it as a commend line argument. 
The file should have the following format:
    _ _ _ 
    _ _ 
    etc.
    0
    extra text
_ represents an valid ATOM (or negrated verison); There MUST be a **space** at the end of the line (see sample).
The output will be in a file called "output.txt". 
Any extra text at the end of the file is duplicated into the output file.
